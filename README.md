### Our Limitations
1. We wanted to use flushbar for PushNotifications. But flushbar package recently (April 7 2020) has a bug and that is why we cannot use it.
2. We will use badge package for messaging to show the numbers but it creates extra margin around the icon which somehow messed out with the layout, so we will try to figure that out.
