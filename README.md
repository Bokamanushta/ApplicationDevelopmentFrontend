# UTM Exchange

The name of our application is UTM Exchange and our stakeholder is UTM International. The main goal of the project is to help and guide exchange students and staff under inbound mobility program who come here in UTM for a very short period of time (mostly one or two semesters) and not very familiar with MALAYSIA and as well as the surroundings of UTM.

### Our Limitations
1. We wanted to use flushbar for PushNotifications. But flushbar package recently (April 7 2020) has a bug and that is why we cannot use it.
2. We will use badge package for messaging to show the numbers but it creates extra margin around the icon which somehow messed out with the layout, so we will try to figure that out.
